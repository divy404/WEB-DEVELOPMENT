    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>

    <p>
        Cuttlefish, or 
         <a href="hihi">cuttlest</a>, are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.

Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[2]

        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators include dolphins, larger fish (including sharks), seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[3] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[3]

        "Cuttle" in "cuttlefish", sometimes called "cuttles",[4] is derived from the Old English name for the species, cudele. The word may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5] Over 120 species of cuttlefish are currently recognised, grouped into six families divided between two suborders. One suborder and three families are extinct.

    <h3>Anatomy and physiology</h3>

    <h4>Visual system</h4>
    <p>Unlike other cephalopods, cuttlefish possess a unique internal structure called the cuttlebone, a highly modified internal shell, which is porous and is made of aragonite. Except for spirula, they are the only coleoid cephalopods with a shell with a phragmocone divided into chambers separated by septa.[15] The pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle.[16] Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that distinguish them from their squid relatives.[17]</p>

<p>The suckers of cuttlefish extend most of the length of their arms and along the distal portion of their tentacles. Like other cephalopods, cuttlefish have "taste-by-touch" sensitivity in their suckers, allowing them to discriminate among objects and water currents that they contact.[27]</p>
